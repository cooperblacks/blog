### Obtain a Free Subdomain Forever

If you are tech-savvy like me, or you like to maintain an online presence using your own identity rather than relying on a mainstream service like a social platform profile or a content creation/sharing place, then it is worth noting to try building or hosting your own website! This is the 2020s, people. Information and skills have never been so easier to search for or learn!

Go on YouTube or Facebook and I am sure you shall find atleast 100 videos/reels telling you exactly what you need to do in order to code. And once you've gotten that in check, get ready to choose an address where people can find you on the internet. Such an "address" is commonly referred to as a **domain**. Sadly, there are no ways to get a full domain for free (since Freenom has closed down since 2022) as of now. Yet, you can easily grab a free **sub**domain which is like leasing parts of another person's domain and inserting your own brand identity to it.

So here is a tentative summary of all the various types of free-to-get subdomains out there in the world right now. They are **free** as long as you have an account on that platform and/or you are hosting your code and files there.

### Key:
- **Custom Domain Support**: Indicates whether the platform allows linking a custom domain to replace the default subdomain. May cost money.
- **HTTPS Support**: Indicates whether the platform provides free SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections.
- **Analytics Available**: Indicates whether the platform offers built-in analytics or integrates with analytics toolsm e.g. Google Analytics.
- **Git Integration**: Indicates whether the platform supports direct integration with Git repositories (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.) for automated deployments.

### Notes:
- The list is based on platforms offering free subdomains as of June 10, 2025, and may not include every possible service due to the vast number of niche providers.
- Always verify the latest offerings and limitations on each platform’s official website, as features and availability may change over time.

## Need a domain instead?
If you are in need of an actual domain, like `example.com` then you might want to check the availability via [tldes.com](https://tldes.com/cheapest-domains). This gem of a website always helps me to bulk-search across multiple registrars to see if a particular domain name is available or not. And also it allows me to compare pricing between different registrars in terms of their registration and renewal rates.

If you can afford about $10-$20 a year to keep a domain alive, feel free to check that link out! (This is not sponsored, so you do NOT receive any special discounts. If I find any, I shall post them later on.)
