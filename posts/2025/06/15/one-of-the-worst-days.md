# One of the Worst Days

Just know that today had been the most awful day of my life, with multiple minor accidents and tragedies that had befallen upon my luck and fate, since 2023. My mind is in a completely vulnerable/shocked state and I am confused about what I should do. (Please help me by keeping me in your prayers.)

Thank you for reading this, whoever you are. I might not be able to keep up my Git streak for too long.
