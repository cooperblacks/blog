### Why I Decided To Start A Blog Here

Hullo there, geeky/freaky fellow! Indeed, if you have stumbled upon here somehow, it must be due to one of 2 reasons:
1. You are a reasonably geeky person overly interested in exploring new things
2. You are a curiously freaky netizen who just reached this corner of the internet after iterations of a stalking session.

Anyways, this is a rather rough start to introduce myself and this virtual place. You have my apologies for that.

Back in the days of the early internet era, people like you and me used to start a 'web log' (**blog** for short) of what they had done in their day. Kind of like a public journal of their activities. Over time, peoples' lives became busier and uneasier, so the idea almost got abandoned if not for the advent of ways to monetize their work through paid reviews, advertisements, affiliate marketing, etc. which have kept personal websites alive to this day. People have less time for reading unless there is an immediate need for it. Not many of us read for pleasure or leisure a we used to. Thus, with a changing demographic and an evolving economy of technologies, the traditional kind of blogs are quite hard to find in the modern age.

Blogs are basically text-based 'vlogs' (video logs) as some of you Gen Z claimants might be more familiar with.

What about this one? Well, I started this blog as a way to utilize GitHub's **commit timestamps** and easy-to-use **markdown formatting** via free-to-host GitHub Pages, so that I can have an online space where I can say and write about anything I want without having to comply with stricter set of rules or "censorship" that mainstream writing platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) have to offer. The timestamps are also helpful in maintaining a verification method for chronologically having rights to any new ideas that I pioneered ahead of everyone else. And the independence and freedom of speech is insane - so that I can reveal certain controversial facts about any evildoers regardless of any amount of power, money, religion or bias. In a self-hosted blog such as this, we are our own reporter, editor and publisher. So, as an internet journalist I am here to deal with facts and fight for justice without being terrorized by governments and big names.

I want to share my knowledge and experiences, basically. Even if they may seem very ordinary or special to me, as long as I can offer some slices of life for everyone to learn or be entertained from, who am I keep them to myself only? Just as the popular saying goes:

> *One man's trash is another man's treasure*

I always try to keep my writing as short as possible, since I personally do not wish to bore my audience with useless jargon or 'filler' material. But if you love reading as a hobby, I hope to serve the finest of delicacies for your eager eyes.

Thanks for arriving here, and I hope you have a wonderful day!
